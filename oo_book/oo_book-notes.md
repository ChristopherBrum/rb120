## The Object Model

### Why OOP?

OOP was developed to help deal with growing codebases and their complexity. Previous to the OOP programming paradigm when changes needed to be made to large codebases it would result in a ripple effect of bugs throughout the program due to dependencies. OOP provides a way of creating containers for data so that it could be used and changed without effecting the entire program. OOP programs would operate as the interaction of many small parts.

#### A Few Defintitions

- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Module
  A module allows us to group reusable code into one place. We use modules in our classes by using the include method invocation, followed by the module name. Modules are also used as a namespace.

### What are Objects?

### Classes Define Objects

#### Instantiation
